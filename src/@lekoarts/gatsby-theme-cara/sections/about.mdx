## About

> Eager learner. My interest in the field of software development grows every day.

Young University student. I first discovered programming in my last year of highschool during the summer. I just wanted to have a unique skill to have under my belt, and at the time I always wanted to make my own game so why not programming? Before I knew it my interest evolved from just making games to being really fascinated about the different ways code can make interactions with the computer possible.
